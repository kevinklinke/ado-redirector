**Last Updated:** January 12, 2026

## Overview
Azure DevOps URL Redirector is a simple browser extension that redirects old Azure DevOps URLs to the new format.

This extension does **NOT**:
- Collect any personal information
- Track your browsing history
- Store any data locally or remotely
